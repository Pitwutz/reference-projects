## Academic Background

### Bachelor's Thesis (2021)
- **Title**: [Bachelor Thesis - Peter Falterbaum](bachelor_thesis/bachelor_thesis_peter_falterbaum.pdf)
- **Institution**: DHBW Stuttgart
- **Program**: Wirtschaftsinformatik (Business Informatics)
- **Focus**: Utility and barrier-oriented evaluation of client security solutions using HP Sure Admin as a case study

### Master's Thesis (2025)
- **Title**: [Master Thesis - Peter Falterbaum](master_thesis/master_thesis_peter_falterbaum.pdf)
- **Institution**: NOVA Information Management School
- **Program**: Master in Data Science and Advanced Analytics (Business Analytics specialization)
- **Abstract**: Smart cities are evolving rapidly and urban planners often rely on transactional trip data such as GPS traces, mobile phone or smart card data to analyze mobility patterns within a city. However, this kind of data lacks contextual information such as purpose or travel mode, crucial for urban transport planning and for deeper insights into mobility patterns. Travel diaries provide this context by covering trip-related data as well as sociodemographic and behavioral data. Conventional methods like clustering or PCA flatten the data into two dimensions, breaking the interdependence among features such as origin, destination, and time. The literature has shown that Non-negative Tensor Factorization (NNTF) is able to reveal latent mobility patterns that capture these feature relationships. We employ a systematic 2×2 research design comparing CANDECOMP/PARAFAC (CP) and Tucker decomposition methods across Utrecht and Rotterdam, analyzing both weekday and weekend travel patterns. Results for Utrecht guide the narrative; the full Rotterdam replication appears in the appendix to test robustness. We analyze the results in terms of reconstruction performance and interpretability (pattern distinctiveness). We find Tucker to validate the patterns and their characteristics found with CP and to achieve clearer temporal peaks with more distinct active zones. We identified distinct patterns in suburban areas of Utrecht on weekdays, where most local trips were done by car (39% of trips). When the destination was the city center instead, the main mode shifted to public transportation (public transportation 37% of trips; car 8% of trips), with every second trip being for shopping activities. This was especially evident for late afternoon and weekend trips. For weekdays in Rotterdam, we found clear student commuting patterns from residential areas to campus in the morning. The proposed framework can inform urban transport planners and is adaptable to other cities and finer spatial granularity.
